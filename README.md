# Plant Disease Classification using Deep Learning
This GitHub repository contains code and resources for a plant disease classification project using deep learning models. The project focuses on using convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to identify diseases in plant images.

## Features:

Implementation of deep learning models for plant disease classification.
Data preprocessing and augmentation techniques for improved model performance.
Training, validation, and evaluation of models on a diverse dataset.
Visualization tools to assess model predictions and performance.
## Files and Folders:

notebook.ipynb: Jupyter Notebook with code for data processing, model training, and evaluation.
images/: Sample images used for visualization.
model.h5: Trained deep learning model in HDF5 format.
## Getting Started:

Clone the repository: git clone https://github.com/your-username/plant-disease-classification.git
Open and run the notebook.ipynb to execute the project.
## Requirements:

Python 3.6+
TensorFlow 2.x
